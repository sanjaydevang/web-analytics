ExerciseMinder Digital Marketing Simulation
This repository contains the analysis and results of the "Digital Marketing Simulation: Media Attribution at ExerciseMinder" conducted as part of an assignment. Acting as the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) for the fitness app ExerciseMinder, the objective was to increase the installed base by 200% over the next five years while maintaining a Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) of 2.5 or higher.

Project Overview
In this project, various marketing strategies were tested across different media channels through simulations on the HBS platform. The goal was to determine which campaigns and channels were most effective for customer acquisition and retention, and to optimize spending for maximum ROMI.

Key Questions Answered
Which campaigns are effective for customer acquisition?
Which campaigns are effective for customer retention?
Which media channels are more effective than others, and how do they affect each other?
How did intuition, analytics (e.g., regression analysis), and A/B testing guide decisions?
Channels Analyzed
The simulation included the following media channels:

Television: Broad reach and visibility.
Facebook: Targeted engagement based on user demographics.
Unbranded: Generic search or ad campaigns.
Branded: Direct brand-focused ads and search.
Email: Personalized customer engagement.
Methodology
The approach combined intuition, data analytics, and A/B testing to make informed marketing decisions:

Intuition helped in forming initial assumptions about effective channels for acquisition and retention.
Regression Analysis provided a data-driven foundation for these assumptions by showing how channel spending impacts key performance metrics.
A/B Testing allowed testing of different messaging and strategies within channels, optimizing campaigns based on user response.
Key Findings
Customer Acquisition: Television and Facebook were the most effective channels for acquiring new users, providing a mix of broad reach and targeted engagement.
Customer Retention: Email and Branded campaigns were most effective for retaining existing users, leveraging personalized communication and reinforcing brand loyalty.
Channel Interdependence: Television and Facebook boosted the effectiveness of Branded campaigns by increasing brand awareness, while Email helped retain users initially acquired via other channels.
